Things still to do for pyflag in no order of priority:

* Write a vfs driver test suite:
  - read(0), read(-10), read(maxint)
  - seek(0), seek(maxint), seek(100), seek(0,1), seek(10,1), seek(-10,1), seek(0,2), seek(10,2), seek(-10,2)

* FTP Scanner
* NFS Scanner

* Proper parser based search criteria in Table widget 

* Rapid file viewer - view the contents of files based on their mime type with rapid next/previous button so we can quickly review many files - possibly with an autorefresh for truely automated reviewing. This is useful for reviewing html pages from cache or network traffic.

* Reorganise the VFS entries for Network Forensics in a more logical way.
