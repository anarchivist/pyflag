This directory represents the IO subsystem. It is based on Sleuthkit 1.67:

http://www.sleuthkit.org/sleuthkit/index.php


Major changes to it included:
1) Ability to use IO subsystems for access to:
	- Encase image files
	- sgzip image files
	- Split DD image files
2) IO subsystem is exception enabled and has a natural python module.

Due to the heavy modifications to the original Sleuthkit version, this version is maintained within the flag CVS.
