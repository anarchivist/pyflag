	F.L.A.G Forensic and Log Analysis GUI
	    http://pyflag.sourceforge.net

This application is designed to assist IT security professionals with
analysing log files, tcpdump files and hard disk images for forensic
evidence. Flag utilises Ethereal (http://www.ethereal.com) for network
packet disection and sleuthkit (http://www.sleuthkit.org) for hard
disk filesystem analysis.

This the official python successor of the original flag written in
perl. It has been re-written from the ground up to be cleaner, simpler
and more managable.

pyflag is designed to run on Linux and has been tested on recent
versions of Redhat/Fedora and Debian (Stable/Testing). It performs
data analyis using a mysql database. It is written in python and
should be portable to other unix-like systems.

Installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.
