Python Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) library
=================================================

This provides the Python "mms" module, which contains several classes for
the creation and manipulation of MMS messages (multimedia messages) used in
mobile devices such as cellular telephones.

Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) is a messaging service for the mobile
environment standardized by the WAP Forum and 3GPP. To the end-user MMS is
very similar to the text-based Short Message Service (SMS): it provides
automatic immediate delivery for user-created content from device to device.

In addition to text, however, MMS messages can contain multimedia content such
as still images, audio clips and video clips, which are binded together
into a "mini presentation" (or slideshow) that controls for example, the order
in which images are to appear on the screen, how long they will be displayed,
when an audio clip should be played, etc. Furthermore, MMS messages do not have
the 160-character limit of SMS messages.

An MMS message is a multimedia presentation in one entity; it is not a text
file with attachments.
 
This library enables the creation of MMS messages with full support for
presentation layout, and multimedia data parts such as JPEG, GIF, AMR, MIDI,
3GP, etc. It also allows the decoding and unpacking of received MMS messages.
