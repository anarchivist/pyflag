        vmodules.py
      Description:
        Changed the create_addr_space API so that it does
	not require types or filname.  This was an

5.17.2008     Volatility-1.3    awalters
    * Feature: New Object Model
    * Files:
        forensics/registry.py
	memory_objects/Windows/xp_sp2.py

	forensics/object2.py
	forensics/win32/meta_info.py
	vutils.py
      Description:
        Added a new object model to make navigating the data

        volatility
        memory_plugins/example1.py
        memory_plugins/example2.py
      Description:
        Added an entirely new plugin infrastructure.  Now it is 
        possible to load the commands dynamically just by adding
        them to the correct directory.  This will allow people
        to support their own modules. This work is based on a 
        similar registry implementation found in PyFlag. 
        Thanks to Michael Cohen and David Collett for the great 
        work they have done and help getting this code integrated.

        forensics/win32/network.py
        forensics/win32/datetime.py
      Description:
          Added native hiberfil support.  Also added the ability
          to convert from hiberfil to linear format.  Now all the
          commands can be run against hiberfils natively.  This
          is accomplished through the new hiberfil address space.
          Thanks to Matthieu Suiche and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt for
          all the great work they have done with hiberfil parsing
          and the xpress compression algorithm.

        forensics/win32/datetime.py
      Description:
          Added an entirely new OO scanning infrastructure. This allows
          for extremely fast scanning and easier scanning across the
          logical address spaces.  As part of this we also ported the 
          scanning modules over to the new infrastructure. Thanks to
          Michael Cohen and Andreas Schuster for the help and ideas 
          to get this working!

          Fixed an off by 1 error in get_available_address for
	  non-pae machines that seemed to have crept back in. Also
	  changed the name of usrdmp to memdmp since it is really
	  dumping a processes addressable memory. Thanks Eoghan Casey!

	  forensics/win32/handles.py
      Description:
          Added the ability to dump files and dlllist by pid or EPROCESS
	  offset.  One reason this was asked for was to deal with data
	  only attacks which may remove the process from process list.

    * Bug: hidden processes
      Files:
        vmodules.py
      Description:
        Both usrdmp and memmap were unable to handle hidden processes. They
