Volatility Framework - Volatile memory extraction utility framework
============================================================================

The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools,
 implemented in Python under the GNU General Public License, for the
extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
The extraction techniques are performed completely independent of the
system being investigated but offer visibilty into the runtime state
of the system. The framework is intended to introduce people to the
techniques and complexities associated with extracting digital artifacts
from volatile memory samples and provide a platform for further work into
this exciting area of research.

The Volatility distribution is available from: 
https://www.volatilesystems.com/default/volatility

Volatility should run on any platform that supports 
Python (http://www.python.org)

Volatility supports investigations of Microsoft Windows XP Service 
Pack 2 memory images. 

Volatility does not provide memory sample acquisition
capabilities. For acquisition, there are both free and commercial
solutions available. If you would like suggestions about suitable 
acquisition solutions, please contact us at:

volatility (at) volatilesystems (dot) com

Volatility currently provides the following extraction capabilities for 
memory samples:

  - Image date and time
  - Running processes
  - Open network sockets
  - Open network connections
  - DLLs loaded for each process
  - Open files for each process
  - Open registry keys for each process
  - OS kernel modules
  - Mapping physical offsets to virtual addresses
  - Virtual Address Descriptor information
  - Addressable memory for each process
  - Memory maps for each process
  - Extract executable samples
  - Scanning examples: processes, threads, 
       sockets, connections, modules

Volatility also supports a variety of sample file formats and the
ability to convert between these formats:

  - Raw linear sample (dd)
  - Hibernation file
  - Crash dump file
