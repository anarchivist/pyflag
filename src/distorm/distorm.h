 * Input:
 *         offset - Origin of the given code (virtual address that is), NOT an offset in code.
 *         code - Pointer to the code buffer to be disassembled.
 *         length - Amount of bytes that should be decoded from the code buffer.
 *         dt - Decoding mode, 16 bits (Decode16Bits), 32 bits (Decode32Bits) or AMD64 (Decode64Bits).
 *         result - Array of type _DecodeInst which will be used by this function in order to return the disassembled instructions.
 *         maxInstructions - The maximum number of entries in the result array that you pass to this function, so it won't exceed its bound.
 *         usedInstructionsCount - Number of the instruction that successfully were disassembled and written to the result array.
 * Output: usedInstructionsCount will hold the number of entries used in the result array
 *         and the result array itself will be filled with the disassembled instructions.
 * Return: DECRES_SUCCESS on success (no more to disassemble), DECRES_INPUTERR on input error (null code buffer, invalid decoding mode, etc...),
 *         DECRES_MEMORYERR when there are not enough entries to use in the result array, BUT YOU STILL have to check for usedInstructionsCount!
 * Side-Effects: Even if the return code is DECRES_MEMORYERR, there might STILL be data in the
 *               array you passed, this function will try to use as much entries as possible!
 * Notes:  1)The minimal size of maxInstructions is 15.
 *         2)You will have to synchronize the offset,code and length by yourself if you pass code fragments and not a complete code block!
