* Wed Aug 27 16:31:30 CEST 2003 Klaus Knopper
- Removed exceed get_file()
- Changed spinlocking code
- Not using asynchronous io request queue anymore

* Sat Jul 19 16:31:30 CEST 2003 Klaus Knopper
- Added multiple cloop device (losetup) support (default 8)
- Removed Kernel 2.2 support

- file=/path/to/file parameter is now optional

* Thu May 15 23:25:40 CEST 2003 Klaus Knopper
- Replaced offset-buffer kmalloc() by vmalloc() for Kernel 2.4
  for huge images (DVD)
- Added atomic stuff for clo_busy

* Wed Jan  8 2003 Eduard Bloch
- added minimalistic hooks for devfs support, target file is /dev/cloop/0

* Sat Aug 17 2002 Klaus Knopper
- Removed ll_rw_blk() in favor of do_generic_file_read for
  better NFS support
- Modified Kernel messages
- Changed -EPERM to -EROFS for mount

* Wed Apr 24 2002 Klaus Knopper
- Added support for block devices as underlying file
  (Thanks to Rob Browning)

* Wed Mar 21 2002 Klaus Knopper
- zlib update to 1.1.4

* Mon Dec 25 2001 Klaus Knopper
- Removed blkdev_dequeue and list_add for clean request handling
- Moved global variables to cloop_device struct

* Thu Nov 15 2001 Klaus Knopper
- Added EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL for new modutils fussiness

* Tue Jul 31 2001 Klaus Knopper
- Checking filp_open() for IS_ERR() to prevent oopses for nonexistent files
- Cleanup of create_compressed_fs.c for newer version of gcc

* Fri Jun 15 2001 Klaus Knopper
- Removed down()/up() because they caused the freeze mentioned earlier
- replaced by clo_busy variable

* Sat Jun 10 2001 Klaus Knopper
- Kernel 2.4 compatibility fixes
- still hunting kernel freeze bug when doing heaving IO!

* Wed Jan 17 2001 Klaus Knopper
- Kernel 2.4 compatibility (untested)

* Thu Sep 21 2000 Klaus Knopper
- fixed a memory leak in load_buffer()

* Tue Sep 12 2000 Klaus Knopper
- whatever it was that caused the deadlocks, the efficiency
  improvement in load_buffer (read consecutive blocks in a
  single ll_rw_blk()-call) seems to work around it. Needs
  more tests.

* Sat Aug 19 2000 Klaus Knopper
- replaced scratch buffer memory allocation

* Fri Aug 11 2000 Klaus Knopper
- Fixed Makefile for SMP

* Wed Aug  9 2000 Klaus Knopper
- Changed vmalloc back to kmalloc (vmalloc occasionally blocks
  when paging)

* Wed Jun 14 2000 Klaus Knopper
- Fixed out-of-place brelse,
- Fixed possible buffer overflow in memcpy,
- Added 'file=/path/to/file' module option for compressed file name,
- Added support for underlying devices with varying blocksize,
- Fixed (?) spinlocking for non-SMP.
