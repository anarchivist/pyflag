To do/think about:
* ewfinfo: add date format in ewfinfo to month in text - no interpretation differences possible
* Enhance error handling - no program exit but a nice return - nicer prints - return error in sector message
* enhance UTF16 conversion code
* write: add additional data to file for different EWF formats
* ewfacquire: make encase5 file option default
* write: allow more than 255 segment files
* header2: enhance utf conversion routine
* read: always compare a data section with the volume/disk section
* read: build in additional constraints
* read: remove file descriptor check in last_offset calculation?
  if( ( section_list_entry->file_descriptor == file_descriptor ) && ( section_list_entry->start_offset < last_offset ) && ( last_offset < section_list_entry->end_offset ) )
* all: due to 20060505 fix give all value definitions a default value - looks nicer
* read: correct for errors in the table or table2 section
* write: reduce multiple successive entries to a single
* ewfacquire: add overview to confirm user input, otherwise restart input query
* add SMART support
* add LVF support - vtree section
* write: change algorithm to fill files upto file size

Further analysis of the EWF format:
* media type
* password hash
* 16 bytes in hash section

Possible performance improvements:
* create a offset table per segment file - create it on demand - section list per segment table is done
* build offset table while reading ?

* worked on ewfacquire read on error
* added alternative write method to test acquired images against existing tooling
* ewfaquire: able to produce exact media data as linen
* write: what if read error is in last chunk and it is smaller than chunk size !?

Version: 20060517
* removed duplicate include from notify.c

Version: 20060516
* added media size to ewfinfo
* worked on ewfacquire read on error

Version: 20060513
* minor adjustment in libewf.h - ewf_close renamed to libewf_close

Version: 20060505
* Fix for older compilers like gcc 2.95 - rewrite to older C statements

Version: 20060424
* added warning macro to allow overriding some fatal errors
* allow overriding invalid CRC's
* refactored crc check in ewf_section to file_read - for scope of handle and uniformity within the code
* further analysis of unknown values in hash section - also found difference in signature value Encase4 and Encase5

Version: 20060423
* Fix for Solaris in definitions.h

Version: 20060422
* Fixed missing PRI definitions on OpenBSD - now defines in definitions.h
* changed sprintf to snprintf
* added device size determination for OpenBSD
* fixed bug in header values parsing for empty first value empty
* added compression level definition
* ewfinfo: add compression media information in ewfinfo - Encase5 format only
* write: moved compression type functionality from ewfacquire into library

Version: 20060419
* Adjusted write method - to fix filesize problem
* Correction of verbose print of last chunk number
* the write function works only when a data section is at the start of the file - why ? not a bug in write
  but in read the first offset in the segment table was filled with 0 instead of 13 which is the size
  of the file header

Version: 20060418
* Tested on FreeBSD 6.0 needed to add include header in ewf_sectors.h
* Adjusted Make to be more generic and to work on FreeBSD 6.0

Version: 20060415
* changed u_int to uint
* removed LIBEWF_ types
* zlib uses a long which varies per 32 and 64 bit architecture using an intermediate variable
  fixes not able to read compressed images on a x86_64 architecure
* Memory corruption bug in segment table filename fixed

Version: 20060414
* Fixed previous offset size
* removed memcpy assignments
* type fixed malloc assignments
* removed (void *) from memset
* reduced the amount of int definions
* changed printf formaters
* added status indication to ewfexport using callback function in read_from_file_descriptor
* added quiet option to ewfexport and ewfacquire
* removed dependency on libiconv - created a naive utf16 to ascii conversion
* moved header string generation code to header_values
* added time string generation code to header_values
* added acquire options for compression and file type to ewfacquire
* code now partially fixed for x86_64 systems fixed malloc statement, printf sizes, and some type definitions
* additional changes to memcpy statements made
* Use header_values for write
* ewfacquire fix error print on correct fixed value
* ewfacquire fix for empty input values
* ewfacquire fix strange image file rights
* ewfacquire fix image filename weird characters - one byte off allocation problem in ewfacquire
* ewfacquire allow for a default value - for fixed values
* ewfacquire can now acquire devices on works on Mac OS-X/Darwin
* fix write crc error in chunk on mac os x
* ewfacquire add EWF file size input possibility - check upper bound 2Gb, lower bound 1440k
* fix write bug with small file size 1440k - for floppy image - this has to do if
  both the filesize and the ewf size are the same - write will adjust with one additional
  segment file

Version: 20060413
* Used LIBEWF_VERSION in executables
* Added file signature function to library for integration in The SleuthKit
* Added md5.h for allowing to do with different MD5 calculation code bases
  like the one integrated in the The SleuthKit

Version: 20060412

Version: 20060411
Nearing release version, so started logging changes
* Removed memory leak with duplicate header assignment to handle
* Renamed ewfmd5sum to ewfverify - still have to enhance functionality
* Renamed ewfcat to ewfexport - still have to enhance functionality
* Added time parsing functionality to ewfinfo - date format is currently
  fixed in MM/DD/YYYY
* Enhanced password and compression header value output in ewfinfo
