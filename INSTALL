Optional Features:
==============
The following steps are recommended to do prior to using Flag.

1) Flag may use the NSRL when loading new filesystems. If you have the
    NSRL ISOs, you can mount them somewhere and then use the
    utilities/NSRL_load.sh script to load the NSRL into the database.

2) Flag can download the whois databases for use when importing log
   files. By Downloading the whois databases its possible to do very
   fast whois lookups on every IP in imported logs and then see the
   contact details for each network owner.
