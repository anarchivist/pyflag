PyFLAG Installation instructions.
========================

PyFlag is shipped in 3 different ways. The choice of which release
file to select depends on individual choices (e.g. if a development
environment is needed). The simplest distribution to install and use
is the Binary+MySQL release, while the most technically challenging
setup to achieve is compiling the source tar ball.

This file covers installation instructions for all distributions. If
you are not comfortable with compiling from source and satisfying all
dependencies, the Binary+MySQL release is your obvious choice.

Binary+MySQL distribution:
--------------------------------------
This distribution contains a stand alone version of the mysql server
software. It is designed to be completely self contained and therefore
has no external dependencies other than a fairly recent version of
glibc. This distribution should run on most flavours of Linux and has
been thoroughly tested on sarge. To install simply:

- Download the tarball.
- Unpack the tarball in a directory of your choice.
- cd into this directory and then execute ./flag.sh
- point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/

The first time that flag is run, you will be asked to fill in a number
of parameters. This will create a ~/.pyflagrc file in your home
directory.

Binary distribution:
--------------------------
This is a self contained distribution, which does not have an embedded
mysql server. You will need to have a working mysql server
somewhere. It may be on a different server than the server used to run
pyflag, but you will need to have root level access to the database
server. This is required in order to drop and create databases.

Log into the mysql server by using the mysql utility (If you just
installed mysql there is no root password set, so the -pxxxx can be
omitted):
bash$  mysql -u root -pxxxx
mysql> create database pyflag;
mysql> grant all on *.* to root@localhost identified by "Y0urP1ssw0rdH3r3";
mysql> quit

The grant command create a root level account on the database. You can
replace localhost with the actual host you intend to log in
from. Note that mysql does not have a root password by default, but
PyFlag _requires_ that you have a root password set for the mysql
server when running in this mode. This is best practice anyway, and
you should never consider running a mysql server with a blank root
password.

Now from the shell, populate the initial database:
cat db.setup | mysql -u root -pY0urP1ssw0rdH3r3 -h localhost pyflag

Source Package:
-----------------------
If you wish to develop modules for PyFlag or contribute, we encourage
you to download the source distribution. To install from source you
will need to have the mysql database set up as described above, and
have all library dependencies satisfied. Since the list of library
dependencies changes very often, we will not provide an exhaustive
list here.

At the very least swig and python-dev are required, as well as
python-mysqldb, clamav. Also ploticus, and ethereal sources are
required (If you do not wish to use the TCPDump modules, the ethereal
sources are not needed - flag should be ready to run by the time
ethereal is compiled).

A a recent (Feb 05) build on a sarge (debian) machine required the
following to be downloaded to the sources/ directory:

  ethereal-0.10.2.tar.bz2
  libpng-2.2.8-config.tar.gz
  pl230src.tar.gz
  msleuthkit-1.73.tar.gz

Tarballs in the sources/ directory are built automatically when 
you type "make" in the top level directory.

Optional Features:
==============
The following steps are recommended to do prior to using Flag.

1) Flag may use the NSRL when loading new filesystems. If you have the
    NSRL ISOs, you can mount them somewhere and then use the
    utilities/NSRL_load.sh script to load the NSRL into the database.

2) Flag can download the whois databases for use when importing log
   files. By Downloading the whois databases its possible to do very
   fast whois lookups on every IP in imported logs and then see the
   contact details for each network owner.
