PyFLAG Installation instructions
================================

PyFlag is now shipped with an autoconf build system. For most systems
you should be able to do:

./configure
make
make install

On Debian this installs pyflag into:

/usr/local/lib/pyflag
/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/share/pyflag/
/usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages/pyflag/

--------------
Pre-Requisites
--------------

The following package pre-requisites are required. This is what they
are named on debian/Ubuntu - other distributions might name them
differently:

sudo apt-get install \
python2.4 \
python2.4-mysqldb \
python2.4-imaging \
python2.4-pexpect \
python2.4-ctypes \
python2.4-dev \
libextractor-dev \
libclamav-dev \
libpcap-dev \
zlib1g-dev \
libmagic-dev \
mysql-server \
mysql-client \
libtool \
make \
g++ \
automake1.9 \
swig1.3

To make the debian package you also need: fakeroot

---------
SQL Setup
---------

Once you are installed, you need to set the root password on mysql:

  mysqladmin -u root password "password"

----------
Run PyFlag
----------

Run pyflag with:

  pyflag [port number]

Run the pyflag shell (pyflash) with:

  pyflash

=================
Optional Features
=================

The following steps are recommended to do prior to using Flag.

1) Flag may use the NSRL when loading new filesystems. If you have the
    NSRL ISOs, you can mount them somewhere and then use the
    utilities/NSRL_load.sh script to load the NSRL into the database.

2) Flag can download the whois databases for use when importing log
   files. By Downloading the whois databases its possible to do very
   fast whois lookups on every IP in imported logs and then see the
   contact details for each network owner.

=================
Debug/Development
=================

If you want to tinker with the source you should probably install to a different location (so you don't need root to edit files).  The scripts in the test directory are set-up to work with this install process:

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/var/tmp/build/pyflag
make
make install

Now run pyflag and pyflash like:

~/pyflag/tests$ ./pyflag
~/pyflag/tests$ ./pyflash
