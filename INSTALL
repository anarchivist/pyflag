To install pyflag you must have a working mysql server somewhere. It
may be on a different server than the server used to run pyflag, but
you will need to have root level access to the database server. This
is required in order to drop and create databases.

Log into the mysql server by using the mysql utitlity (If you just
installed mysql there is no root password set, so the -pxxxx can be
omitted):
bash$  mysql -u root -pxxxx
mysql> create database pyflag;
mysql> grant all on *.* to root@localhost identified by "password";
mysql> quit

The grant command create a root level account on the database. You can
replace localhost with the actuall host you intend to log in
from. Note that mysql does not have a root password by default, but
PyFlag _requires_ that you have a root password set for the mysql
server. This is best practice anyway, and you should never consider
running a mysql server with a blank root password.

Now from the shell, populate the initial database:
cat setup.db | mysql -u root -ppassword -h 127.0.0.1 pyflag

You may also want to download the NSRL database as well. Consult the
nsrl_load script to load the databases.

To Start PyFlag, cd into the unpacked binary directory, and run:
bash$  ./flag.sh

The first time that flag is run, you will be asked to fill in a number
of parameters. This will create a ~/.pyflagrc file in your home
directory.

Optional Features:
==============

Virus scanning: Flag may use a virus scanner if one is available on
the system. You will need to install the following packages on debian:

libclamav1-dev
clamav-freshclam
clamav-base
clamav

The library is required in order to compile python support for
clamav. You will then need to run the freshclam script in order to
download the latest version of the pattern files.
