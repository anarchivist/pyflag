Description: python-based forensic tool
 The python Forensic Log Analysis GUI was designed to simplify the process of
 log file analysis and forensic investigations.  Often when investigating a 
 large case, a great deal of data needs to be analysed and correlated. Flag 
 uses a database as a backend to assist in managing the large volumes of data.
 This allows flag to remain responsive and expedite data manipulation
 operations.  Flag started off as a project in the Australian Department of 
 Defence.  It is now hosted on sourceforge.
